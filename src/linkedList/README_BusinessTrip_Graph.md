## Approach & Efficiency
I used a graph data structure to represent the airline route map. The `businessTrip` function iterates over the itinerary, checking for the existence of direct flights and calculating the total cost. The approach is efficient with a time complexity of O(n) where n is the number of cities in the itinerary.

## Solution
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zaidizz96/data-structures-and-algorithms.git
   ```
2.  Update the graph data in the Graph class with your own Alaska Airlines route map.

3.  Run the provided test cases or create new ones in the GraphBusiunessTripTests class.
