## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `src/` contains the source code for the main classes.
- `test/` includes JUnit test classes for the sorting functions.
- `build.gradle` is the Gradle build configuration file.
- `README.md` is this documentation file.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-sorting-lab.git
   Open the project in your favorite Java IDE or text editor.
   Explore the source code to understand the sorting functions and how they work.
   Run the JUnit tests to verify the correctness of the sorting algorithms.

## Sorting Functions
The project provides two sorting functions for movies:

- `insertionSortByYearDescending`: Sorts movies by release year in descending order.
- `insertionSortAlphabeticallyIgnoringArticles`: Sorts movies alphabetically by title while ignoring articles (e.g., "A," "An," "The").
You can use these functions to sort a list of Movie objects.

## Tests
The project provides two sorting functions for movies:

- `insertionSortByYearDescending`: Sorts movies by release year in descending order.
- `insertionSortAlphabeticallyIgnoringArticles`: Sorts movies alphabetically by title while ignoring articles (e.g., "A," "An," "The").
You can use these functions to sort a list of Movie objects.
