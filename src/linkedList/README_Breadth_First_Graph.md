# Graph Breadth-First Traversal Challenge

## Description
This coding challenge involves extending the implementation of a graph class to include a breadth-first traversal method.

## Approach & Efficiency
I implemented the breadth-first traversal using a queue to keep track of nodes to visit. The algorithm explores each level of the graph before moving on to the next level. The time complexity is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

## Solution
To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open your Java development environment.
3. Run the main method or JUnit tests to see the breadth-first traversal in action.
